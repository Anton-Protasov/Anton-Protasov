**Hello Everyone** ðŸ‘‹ <br />
My name is **Anton**. <br />
**âš¡ Some facts about me:** <br />
More than 10 years ago I graduated for BMSTU (Bauman Moscow State University). <br />
I wanted to study for IT specialization but something went wrong and <br />
At the moment I`m a HVAC engineer (with relevant work experience more than 10 years). <br />
Currently I really want to change my profession. <br />
I keen on to be an IT specialist (currently I see myself as a Developer), <br />
since it is a big interesting world where majority of things depend on forces and time that you are ready to pay. <br />

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:** <br />
The first language (without taking into account Basic and Pascal) that I`ve chosen is **Java**. <br />
There are some objective reasons for my choice. <br />
All my free time I dedicate for studying Java and some tools that required to be a developer and I like it, <br />
but, honestly speaking, my friends do not very like it ))) <br />
The problem that I have met it is a time - very fewer time to study (around max 4 hours per day), <br />
taking into account my duties, including a work. <br />
I study on the following courses: <br />
1 - https://job4j.ru/ <br />
2 - https://javarush.ru/ <br />
3 - http://www.sql-tutorial.ru/ru/content.html <br />
Links to my training repositories you can find in my profile. <br />
My dream is to get a job in the development and proceed with my education to combine a real work experience and theoretic knolladge from the study. <br />
  
**Languages and Tools:**

I understand and can apply:
- Java Syntax <br />
- Arrays, Collections and Maps (including sorting, comparator) <br />
- The general principles: working with objects, polymorphism, interfaces and inheritance) <br />
- Exceptions <br />
- Functional programming (functional interfaces, Lambda, Stream API) <br />
- jUnit tests <br />
- Data and time <br />
- Input / output streams <br />
- Thread <br />
- Patterns: Singleton, Decorator (Wrapper), Factory method <br />
- JavaDoc <br />
